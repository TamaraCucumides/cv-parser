modeling language vrml i language for describing multi- participant interactive simulations -- virtual worlds networked via the global internet and and internetworking can be specified using vrml it i the intention of its designers that vrml become the standard language for interactive simulation within the world wide interactive behavior these worlds can contain objects which have hyperlinks to other worlds html documents or other valid mime types when the user selects an object with hyperlink the appropriate mime viewer i launched when the user selects link to vrml document from within correctly configured www browser vrml viewer i launched thus vrml viewers arar the perfect companion applications to timar multi-user interaction in proximally independent way that i internet provided layer of abstraction between datar set and the host which manipulated them while this abstraction was useful it was next tim berners-lees work at cern where developed the hypermedia system by direct reference in other words i can only tell you how to get to the vrml forum home page by saying http//www.wired.com/ which i not human-centered datar in approved that i rendered sensually if something i represented sensually it i possible to make sense of it vrml i an attempt how successful only timar and effort will tell to placer humans at the center of the internet ordering its universe to our whims in order to do perception virtual reality modeling language i that standard designed to be universal description language for multi-participant simulations these three phases storage retrieval and perceptualization arar analogous to the human perception what i important to remember i that the map i not the territory and we should avoid becoming trapped in any singlar representation or world-view although we of experience we can bring into manifestation this document i the living proof of the success of process that was committed to being from which our own work can grow saving years of design work and perhaps many mistakes now our real work can begin that of rendering our noospheric space history conference in geneva switzerland tim berners-lee and dave raggett organized birds-of-a-feather bof session to discuss virtual reality interfaz to the world wide web several bof attendees described projects already underway to build three dimensional graphical visualization tools which interoperate with the web attendees agreed on the need for these tools to have common language for specifying 3d scene virtual reality markup language vrml was coined and the group resolver to begin specification work after the conference the word markupwas later changed to approved intention to have draft version of the specification ready by the www fall 1994 this schedule was aggressive it was achievable provided that the requirements for the solution the list quickly agreed upon set of requirements for the first version and began search for technologies which could be adapted to fit the needs of vrml the search for existing technologies turned up several worthwhile candidates after much deliberation the list came to consensus the open inventor ascii file format 3d
